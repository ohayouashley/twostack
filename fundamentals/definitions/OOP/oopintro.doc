Object oriented programming is the most common programming paradigmn 

-what is an Object
-what is a class
-how do we use them together
-how to instantiate objects with custom initial values using a constructor method 
-what is a constructor method
-how to assign and re-assing different values to different instances of the same class
-what is an access modifier
how to make object instances interact with each other - is that what we did with the zoo keeper assginment
-how to implement static methods that can be called from the class iself (rather than a particular instance).

::OBJECT::

-an object is a collection of behaviors and properties that all revolve around the same concept; this collection of behaviors and properties
are called instance members. 
-Objects are created from blueprints of pre-conceived code called classes. 

both of the file names and the - class names need to match the class that your file is called.
