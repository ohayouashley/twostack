::SWITCH STATEMENTS AND TERNARY OPERATORS::

int day = 2;
switch(day){
	case 1:
		System.out.println("Monday");
		break;
	case 2:
		System.out.println("Tuesday");
		break;
	case 3:
		System.out.println("Wednesday");
		break;
	case 4:
		System.out.println("Thursday");
		break;
	case 5:
		System.out.println("Friday");
		break;
	case 6:
		System.out.println("Saturday");
		break;
	case 7:
		System.out.println("Sunday");
		break;
	default:
		System.out.println("There are only seven days in a week...");
}


::Setupis different than if statements

- start with the switch keyword and pass in the variable we are checking
- inside switch, speficy what we want to happen for each possible case-prints out day of the week based on value of our day variable
- includes a default keyword at the bottom which is equivalent to else keyword in an if statement 
- need a break keyword after Default

::ternary operators::

-Allow us to write more concise code

COMPARE else if statement with switch statement 

ELSE IF :

boolean isRaining = true;
    
if(isRaining) {
    System.out.println("Bring an umbrella.");
}
else {
    System.out.println("Have fun!");
}

SWITCH:
System.out.println(isRaining ? "Bring an umbrealla" : "Have fun!");

-The ternary operator consists of three pieces; the condition, the return value if the condition is true, and the return value if the condition is false.
