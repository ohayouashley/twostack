::METHODS::

Methods vs Functions

A method is a function in Java and in OOP generally. A method is a function that belongs to a class. 
**in Java you will only be dealing with methods and never stand alone functions. Even if function is referred to you'll always be using methods.

Java method declaration

Method signatures: every method has a signature.
This method has a signature of guestGreeting(String, String). Notice that the only information contained in the signature is 
public string guestGreeting(String name, String dayPeriod) {  
-The name of the method
-The parameter types

public void coolMethodName(int someNumber, String someString) {
//this would be a signature of coolMethodName(int, String)

Method Overloading

When we name two methods the same thing even though they may behave differently. 

Ex:

public String guestGreeting(String name) {

public String guestGreeting(String name, String dayPeriod) {

Which one would be executed if invoked? It depends on the methods used. In this case it would be guestGreeting(String, String)
