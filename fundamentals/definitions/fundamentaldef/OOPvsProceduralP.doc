OOP - object oriented programming: is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

1. faster and easier to execute
2. provides a clear structure for the programs
helps to keep the Java code DRY and makes the code easier to maintain, modify, debug.
4. makes it possible to create full reuseable applications with less code and shorter developement time. 

Tip: The DRY princikdple is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application,
and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it. 

Java - what are classes and objects? Classes and objects are the two main aspects of OOP.

If a class is fruit an object would be apple, banana, mango.
If a class is car an object is volvo auid and toyota

A class is a template for objects and an object is an instance of a class. 
When the individual objects are created they inherit all the variables and methods from the class. ÃŸ
