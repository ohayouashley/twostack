::CONDITIONALS & OPERATORS::

Conditionals - if else statements and switch statements in conjunction with comparison operators and logical 
operators to control the flow of the program. 

::if statements::

Java syntax:
 if (condition) {
    // what to do if condition is true (instructions if true)
}
// continue with program

Ex:

boolean isRaining = true;
    
if(isRaining) {
    System.out.println("Bring an umbrella.");
}

// this will print to the console "bring an umbrella"

::if/else chains::

We can chain multiple conditions in if-else chain:

Ex:

if(condition) {
    // what to do if condition is true (instructions if true)
}
else if(2nd condition) {        
    // what to do if 2nd condition is true (instructions if 2nd condition is true)
}
// ... can have 0 to many else-if statements ...
else {                           
    // what to do if none of the previous conditions are met (catch-all)
} // can have 1 or no else statement

::if/else statement::

ex: this is a statement which just has if and else not else if.

boolean isRaining = true;
    
if(isRaining) {
    System.out.println("Bring an umbrella.");
}
else {
    System.out.println("Have fun!");
}

::if/else if/else statements::

boolean isRaining = true;
boolean isCold = true;
    
if(isRaining) {
    System.out.println("Bring an umbrella.");
}
else if(isCold) {
    System.out.println("Wear a coat.");
}
else {
    System.out.println("Have fun!");
}


::assignment operator vs comparison operator::

= : is the assignment operator ex: int count = 1; //assigns a value (the SET AS operator)

::comparison::

== equal 
ex:
int count = 1; //assigns value
count == 1; // true
count == 2; // false

!= not equal

> greater than

< less than

>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to

::logical operators::

&& AND both conditions must be true to be true
ex:
int age = 45;
age < 65 && age > 17;
//evaluates to true
//(would pay adult price)

age <110 && age > 65;
//false//is not a senior nor immortal

|| OR one of the conditions must be true
ex:
int age = 77;
age < 10 || age > 65;
//true
//does care what people think

! NOT 
int age = 15;
!(age <15)
//true//may obtain drivers license.
